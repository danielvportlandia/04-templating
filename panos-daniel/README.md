# Project Name

**Author**: Daniel and Panos
**Version**: 1.0.3 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application will render articles by their dates for users to read. Users have the ability to search for articles by either their authors or by their assigned categories. When filtering the targeted articles, all other articles are hidden. This application also utilizes Handlebars templating to populate the articles.

## Getting Started
A user must first retreive the CDN for Handlebars and establish the Handlebars templating in the head script. To improve efficiency a user may also refactor their functions into ES6 arrow functions for clearer reading of the code.

## Architecture
This application utilizes HTML, CSS, JS, the jQuery and Handlebars libraries.
